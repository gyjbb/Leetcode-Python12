## Binary tree theory

Congratulations!\
This is the twelfth day for leetcode python study. Today we will learn more about the Binary Tree!\
The challenges today are about ~~need to delete later~~.

## Binary tree theory
[Reading link](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master/blob/master/problems/%E4%BA%8C%E5%8F%89%E6%A0%91%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80.md)\
Binary tree are often associated with recursion.\
Here we need to learn about the kinds of binary trees, how to store, how to loop through, and the definition of binary tree.\
Priority queue is realized by a heap, and heap is a kind of binary tree, we can store and retrive data from it.\
The items in map and set are ordered, because the two data structures are realized by balanced binary search tree. But the unordered map and set are realized by hash table, and are not ordered.\
recursion 递归   stack\
iteration 迭代   queue\
前序遍历，中序遍历，后续遍历  都描述的是什么时候 遍历到中间的数。\
definition: binary tree is like linked list.\
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left = None, right = Node):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

Recursion is realized by stack.\






## Iteration
